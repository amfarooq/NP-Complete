# NP-Complete
A series of programs designed to provide optimal solutions to popular NP-Complete problems. They are written in C++ and can be run on any C++ compiler. These are a work in progress and I will be updating the files as I come up with better solutions.

I began tackling the problems in this order, and would implore you to view my solutions accordingly:
1. Knapsack
2. Graph Coloring
3. Travelling Salesman
4. Facility Location

There is a folder for each of the different problems containing input data and my current solution for that problem. There is also a pdf with a description of the problem and a README to go along with each of the problems in their respective folders. The README folders will generally be more geared towards describing my solutions, how they work, and areas where they need improvement.

Enjoy!
