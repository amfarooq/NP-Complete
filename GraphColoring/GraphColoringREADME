For The graph coloring problem (or chromatic number problem - see graph coloring pdf) I employ a recursive backtracking algorithm

We start by picking our chromatic number as 1, see if that gives us a solution, if it doesn't then increment our number and try again.

The way to check if it is possible to color a graph with a given chromatic number is as follows:
1) start with our current vertex as 0 (the first vertex)
2) then go through each of the possible colors 0 to n (where n is the chromatic number we are currently dealing with). If this color can be assigned to that node, then assign it and continue on to the next node.
3) if no color works for that node, then backtrack to the previous node and change its color assignment to the next available color over and continue again.
4) Do this for all nodes till we have returned true with appropriate color assignments, or returned false indicating that the current chromatic number will not work for this graph

Since our algorithm goes through all chromatic numbers starting from 1, till we find one that works; the one we end up with will necessarily be the correct (i.e. the smallest possible) chromatic number for the graph.

Problems with this:
It is too exhaustive and takes a long time to complete the backtracking as the graphs get bigger than 50 vertices. To solve this I need to think of a more efficient way to eliminate smaller chromatic numbers as being impossible earlier on in the backtracking. 


Alternate approaches to think about:
We could do this the opposite way. Make each vertex a different color to begin with and cut down on the number of possible colors we can use, making changes to our graph as we do that. Something to think about.
